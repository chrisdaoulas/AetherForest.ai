          <p className={`${lusitana.className} text-1xl mt-5 mb-2  `}>
            The Kayapo indigenous people protect more than 9 million hectares (22 million acres) of Amazon Rainforest (roughly the size of Portugal). They continue to live within their traditional culture. They do not engage in large-scale deforestation and fight to protect their territory, one of the world`s richest ecosystems, from the ravages of the outside world.
          </p>
  
          <p className={`${lusitana.className} text-1xl mt-5 mb-2  `}>
            The area protected by the ~8,000 Kayap√≥ is roughly equal in size to Portugal or South Korea. This area is comprised mostly of primary forest interspersed with a few patches of naturally occurring savannah growing on Brazilian shield bedrock. Kayapo territory is a biodiversity paradise providing sufficient size habitat for sensitive species which are threatened or extirpated in other areas including; white-lipped peccary, tapir, giant armadillo, giant otter, giant anteater, jaguar, hyacinth macaw, harpy eagle, white-whiskered spider monkey, and saki monkey.

            <p className='mb-5'>AmazoniaCoin plays a crucial role in supporting the Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) Kayapo project by leveraging blockchain technology and creating a carbon credit market. Here`s how AmazoniaCoin contributes to the success of the project, by safeguarding the sustainability and protection of the Kayapo indigenous people`s territory:</p>
  
            
            
            <ul>
              <p className='mb-2'><strong>1 .Transparent and Traceable Transactions</strong></p>
              <ul>  
                <li className='mb-5'>AmazoniaCoin utilizes blockchain technology to create a transparent and traceable system for recording transactions related to carbon credits. The decentralized and tamper-evident nature of the blockchain ensures the integrity of the data, providing a trustworthy platform for all stakeholders involved.</li>
                
              </ul>

              <p className='mb-2'><strong>2. Decentralized Tracking of Deforestation</strong></p>
              <ul>  
                <li className='mb-5'> Through the implementation of smart contracts and artificial intelligence (AI) on publicly available satellite data, AmazoniaCoin facilitates the tracking of deforestation rates in protected indigenous areas. The decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures tamper-evident transactions, allowing for trustworthy and accurate recording of environmental data.</li>                
              </ul>
    
              <p className='mb-2'><strong>3. Carbon Credit Generation</strong></p>
              <ul >
                <li className='mb-5'>The Kayapo project involves protecting a vast expanse of Amazon Rainforest, which acts as a significant carbon sink. Through the implementation of smart contracts on the blockchain, AmazoniaCoin facilitates the generation and certification of carbon credits based on the amount of carbon sequestered by the protected forest. This process is crucial for participating in carbon offset programs.</li>
              </ul>

              <p className='mb-2'><strong>4. Native Token Backing</strong></p>
              <ul >
                <li className='mb-5'>AmazoniaCoin`s native token backed by carbon credits serves as the currency within the blockchain-based carbon credit market. Each token represents a quantifiable amount of carbon offset redeemed by sponsors funding ecosystem projects with the Kayapo as beneficiaries, allowing for a standardized and tradable unit that can be exchanged on the market.</li>
              </ul>

              <p className='mb-2'><strong>5. Simulated Voluntary Carbon Market</strong></p>
              <ul >
                <li className='mb-5'>The blockchain-based carbon credit market operates as a simulated Voluntary Carbon Market. This market enables buyers, such as companies and individuals, to purchase carbon credits from the Kayapo project. The funds generated from these transactions contribute to the financial sustainability of the Kayapo indigenous people and support their efforts in preserving the rainforest.</li>
              </ul>

              <p className='mb-2'><strong>6. Funds Allocation to Local Communities</strong></p>
              <ul >
                <li className='mb-5'>As part of the Payment for Ecosystem Services scheme, AmazoniaCoin ensures that funds from the sale of carbon credits are allocated to the local communities, specifically the Kayapo people. The disbursement of funds is contingent on the communities` performance in providing contracted environmental services, such as preventing deforestation within their protected territory.</li>
              </ul>

              
              <p className='mb-2'><strong>7. Indigenous Land Rights Protection</strong></p>
              <ul >
                <li className='mb-5'>The blockchain template employed by AmazoniaCoin guarantees transparent governmental land governance. This is especially important for safeguarding the indigenous land rights of the Kayapo people. The decentralized and publicly accessible nature of the blockchain ensures that land governance practices are accountable and free from external interference.</li>
              </ul>

              <p className='mb-2'><strong>8. Efficiency and Automation</strong></p>
              <ul >
                <li className='mb-10'>By automating processes and leveraging blockchain technology, AmazoniaCoin streamlines the administration of the carbon credit market. This efficiency minimizes the need for manual intervention, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring the fair distribution of funds.</li>
              </ul>
    
              <p className='mb-5'>AmazoniaCoin acts as a catalyst for sustainable governance by combining blockchain technology, carbon credits, and smart contracts to protect indigenous land rights, track deforestation, and allocate funds based on environmental performance. The creation of a blockchain-based carbon credit market not only provides financial incentives for the preservation of the Amazon Rainforest but also establishes a model for transparent and accountable environmental governance. As such, the innovative approach of AmazoniaCoin contributes to the preservation of the Kayapo territory, fostering a balance between economic development and ecological conservation.</p>
