            The Kayapo indigenous people protect more than 9 million hectares (22 million acres) of Amazon Rainforest (roughly the size of Portugal). They continue to live within their traditional culture. They do not engage in large-scale deforestation and fight to protect their territory, one of the world's richest ecosystems, from the ravages of the outside world.

            The area protected by the ~8,000 Kayap√≥ is roughly equal in size to Portugal or South Korea. This area is comprised mostly of primary forest interspersed with a few patches of naturally occurring savannah growing on Brazilian shield bedrock. Kayapo territory is a biodiversity paradise providing sufficient size habitat for sensitive species which are threatened or extirpated in other areas including; white-lipped peccary, tapir, giant armadillo, giant otter, giant anteater, jaguar, hyacinth macaw, harpy eagle, white-whiskered spider monkey, and saki monkey.
